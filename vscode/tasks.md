# VS Code customisation tasks

  1. Additional VS Code configuration:
     * Settings: terminal fonts.
  2. MacOS support for dotfiles and adopt at work:
     1. If a `.gitignore`d file exists default to `PROFILE=work` (or just load profile from it?).
     2. See notes for MacOS specific things and update makefiles.
     3. Create a set of bash aliases for `PROFILE=work` only.
     4. Create a list of VS Code plugins for `PROFILE=work` only.
     5. Create a MacOS.md with vague notes for installing and setting up MacOS.
  3. Add symlink to asfd `~/.tool-versions`? (if so move asfd out of bash?)
  4. Additional extentions to consider:
